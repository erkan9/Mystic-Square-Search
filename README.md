# Mystic-Square-Search

Mystic-Square-Search is a 2D board game where players navigate a board of colored squares in search of hidden treasure. The board is made up of three colors: yellow squares which have been discovered, blue squares which cannot be discovered, and green squares where the treasure could be located. The game begins with the player starting in one of the corners of the board, and they must discover each square around them one by one in order to find the treasure.

However, the game is not without its challenges. Players may encounter block squares which cannot be discovered, and may find themselves blocked in and unable to progress. To combat this, players can reset the board using the smiley face icon. Additionally, a time counter keeps track of how long each game has been played. Will you be able to find the treasure before time runs out?
